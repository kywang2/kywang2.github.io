        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <h3><a id="Biography">Biography</a></h3>
            <p>My name is Kyle Wang.  I was born and raised in Columbus, Ohio.  I went to Ohio State University and graduated in 2016 with a degree in accounting.  
               After graduating, I worked at the 5th largest public accounting firm in the country, RSM US as an Auditor where I was responsible for ensuring the
               accuracy of financial statements for clients in the financial as well as manufacturing and distribution sector.  I worked at RSM US for 2 years before 
               transitioning to Cardinal Health as an Advisor in Accounting where I was responsible for performing the inventory accounting of over 50 pharmacies and 
               hospitals around the country.  After a year at Cardinal Health, I outgrew the monotony of accounting and left to pursue a dream of becoming a 
               professional software developer and be able to lean more on my creativity and critical thinking and work more with logic and mathematics and it's been 
               an amazing journey ever since. </p>.
